# PYTHON OPERATORS

"""
Real world applications of python operators
Arithmetic Operators (+, -, , /, %)
Financial calculations (e.g., EMI, profit/loss, tax
computation)
Scientific simulations and engineering formulas
Comparison Operators (==, >, <, etc.)
User authentication (password match)
Filtering data in analytics dashboards
Logical Operators (and, or, not)
Decision-making in AI models (if conditions)
Complex search queries in databases
Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
Updating counters in games, apps
Tracking inventory or stock levels
Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>)
Cryptography and network security
Image processing and compression
Membership & Identity Operators (in, is)
Searching in large datasets
Object comparison in data structures
Example:
Predicting loan approval using arithmetic + logical operators in ML pre-processing.
